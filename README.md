# STM32f103c8t6 Driver Implementation
This repository contains an implementation of the STM32f103c8t6 ARM microcontroller driver. The driver provides a low-level interface for accessing the hardware peripherals of the microcontroller.

## Getting Started
To get started with using the driver in your project, you will need to have the following software and hardware:

### Software
- Your preferred ARM development environment (e.g. Keil, IAR, GCC)
- STM32f103c8t6 board support package (BSP)
### Hardware
- STM32f103c8t6 development board
- ST Link V2 Programmer
## Installing the Driver
To install the driver in your project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Add the files in the "Driver" folder to your project in your preferred development environment.
3. Configure your development environment to use the STM32f103c8t6 as the target microcontroller.
4. Build the project to ensure that the driver is properly integrated.
## Using the Driver
To use the driver in your code, include the relevant header files and call the driver functions as needed. Refer to the documentation in the header files for more information on the available functions.
